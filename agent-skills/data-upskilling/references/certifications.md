2. **DP-900** — Data Fundamentals (skip if already working with data on Azure)
3. **AI-900** — AI Fundamentals (fast, builds AI vocabulary)
4. **DP-203** — Data Engineer Associate (the big one — invest serious time here)
5. **AI-102** — AI Engineer Associate (Azure AI services depth)
6. **AZ-305** — Solutions Architect Expert (ties it all together)

## AI / ML Certifications & Courses (Non-Microsoft)
